Navigating Files and Directories

Bash
$ ls -F /
ls is the command, with an option -F and an argument /

pwd prints the user’s current working directory.

ls [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory.

cd [path] changes the current working directory.

Most commands take options that begin with a single -.

Directory names in a path are separated with / on Unix, but \ on Windows.

/ on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.

. on its own means ‘the current directory’; .. means ‘the directory above the current one’.
